# Smart Room Automation System (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## üéØ Aim
The aim of this project is to develop a **room automation system** for remote monitoring and control using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
The system automatically manages a **fan** and **room lamp** based on motion detection, improving energy efficiency and convenience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Description
This project simulates a **smart home setup** in Cisco Packet Tracer where:
- A **motion sensor** detects movement inside the room.
- When motion is detected:
  - The **lamp** is switched ON (with a DIM option for energy saving).
  - The **fan** is switched ON (with LOW speed mode available).
- When no motion is detected for a set duration, both appliances turn OFF automatically.
- Remote monitoring is possible using a tablet connected to the home gateway.

## üõ† Components Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer (Simulation Software)  
- Home Gateway (DLC100)  
- Tablet PC (for remote monitoring/control)  
- Fan (with ON/OFF and LOW speed control)  
- Lamp (with ON/OFF and DIM control)  
- Motion Sensor (trigger for automation)  

---

## üöÄ Features
- Automatic control of appliances based on motion detection  
- Energy-saving modes (Fan LOW speed, Lamp DIM)  
- Remote access using a Tablet PC  
- Simple and scalable IoT simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer  

---

## üìä Results
- When motion is detected, the fan and lamp automatically turn ON.  
- Appliances return to OFF state when no motion is detected.  
- DIM and LOW speed modes enhance efficiency.  
- The system successfully demonstrates basic **IoT automation in Packet Tracer**.
